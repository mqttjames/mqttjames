### Hi, I'm Matt 👋

I'm an Electrical Engineering student at the University of Doha for Science and Technology, passionate about **renewable energy**, **power systems**, and **technology that makes a difference**.

I enjoy building things — whether it's a simple Python game or a sustainability-focused device using microcontrollers. I'm currently diving deeper into **machine learning**, especially its role in solving real-world energy challenges. 

🛠️ Projects I’m working on:
- A water quality monitoring device using **Raspberry Pi Pico** and **Date Pits** 🌱
- Participating in the **Shell.ai Hackathon** focused on fuel blend property prediction 🔬
- Python practice projects like Hangman, data analysis exercises, and more

📚 Currently learning:
- Machine Learning and Data Analysis with Python
- Energy systems and smart grids
- Real-time data visualization and optimization tools

🌍 My goal is to combine engineering, sustainability, and AI to help shape a cleaner, more efficient future.

Let’s connect, collaborate, and build something meaningful.
